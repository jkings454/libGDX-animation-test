# animTest - A libGDX "game"
### REQUIREMENTS
1. Java JDK 7 or above.
2. Android Build Tools.

### WHAT IS THIS?
This is a "game" built on the libGDX engine. It's purely for my practice, but if you want to download it for some reason I won't mind.
This is mostly on my GitHub because I'm too lazy to put it on a USB or something.
Good luck getting it to work!
